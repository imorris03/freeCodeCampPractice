                Before starting this topic, you should have at least basic familiarity 
                with using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking 
                at it, consuming the content). You should have a basic work 
                environment set up as detailed in Installing basic software, and 
                understand how to create and manage files.
            </p>
            <p>After learning HTML, you can then move on to learning about more advanced topics such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>CSS</b>, and how to use it to style HTML (for example, alter 
                    your text size and fonts used, add borders and drop shadows, 
                    layout your page with multiple columns, add animations and 
                    other visual effects).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>JavaScript</b>, and how to use it to add dynamic 
                    functionality to web pages (for example, find your location 
                    and plot it on a map, make UI elements appear/disappear 
                    when you toggle a button, save users' data locally on their 
                    computers, and much more).

            <p>
                <dfn>HTML</dfn> (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells 
                web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated 
                or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of 
                elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content 
                to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content 
                into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For 
                example, consider the following line of text:
            </p>
            <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
            <p>
                If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph 
                by enclosing it in a paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) element:
            </p>
            <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section element_of_anatomy" id="element_anatomy">
            <header>Element anatomy</header>
            <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
            <p>The anatomy of our element is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this 
                    example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. 
                    This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. 
                    In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.</li>
                <li><b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element. In this example, 
                    it is the paragraph text.</li>
                <li><b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that 
                    it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the 
                    element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error 
                    that can produce peculiar results.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section nesting" id="nesting_elements">
            <header>Nesting elements</header>
            <p>
                Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. If we 
                wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a 
                &lt;strong&gt; element, which means that the word is to have strong(er) text 
                formatting:
            </p>
            <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
            <p>
                There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened 
                the p element first, then opened the strong element. For proper nesting, we 
                should close the strong element first, before closing the p.
            </p>
            <p>The following is an example of the wrong way to do nesting:</p>
            <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code>
            <p>
                The <b>tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one 
                another</b>. With the kind of overlap in the example above, the browser has to guess 
                at your intent. This kind of guessing can result in unexpected results.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not all elements follow the pattern of opening tag, content, and closing tag. 
                Some elements consist of a single line, which is typically used to insert/embed 
                something into the document. Such elements are called void elements. Some examples
                include: &lt;img&gt;, &lt;meta&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, &lt;source&gt;, &lt;br&gt;, and 
                &lt;hr&gt;.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section attributes" id="element_attributes">
            <header>Element attributes</header>
            <p>
                Elements can also have attributes. Attributes contain extra information about the 
                element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the class attribute is 
                an identifying name used to target the element with style information.
            </p>
            <p>An attribute should have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one 
                    attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)</li>
                <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
                <li>An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.</li>
            </ul>

                Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's examine how 
                individual elements combine to form an entire HTML page:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
    &lt;html lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; &gt;
        &lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is my page&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>Here we have:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</b> â€” doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists 
                    of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to 
                    act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be 
                    considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other 
                    useful things. However, these days, they don't do much and are basically 
                    just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you 
                    need to know for now.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</b>: The &lt;html&gt; element. This element wraps 
                    all the content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</b>: The &lt;head&gt; element. This element acts 
                    as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page, <b>that 
                    isn't the content</b> the page will show to viewers. This includes keywords 
                    and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS to style 
                    content, character set declarations, and more. You will learn more about 
                    this in the next article of the series.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;</b>: The &lt;meta&gt; element. 
                    This element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML 
                    meta-related elements, like &lt;base&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, &lt;script&gt;, 
                    &lt;style&gt; or &lt;title&gt;. The charset attribute specifies the 
                    character encoding for your document as UTF-8, which includes most 
                    characters from the vast majority of human written languages. With this 
                    setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might contain. 
                    There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems 
                    later.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</b>: The &lt;title&gt; element. This sets the 
                    title of the page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the 
                    page is loaded in. The page title is also used to describe the page when 
                    it is bookmarked.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</b>: The &lt;body&gt; element. This contains all 
                    the content that displays on the page, including text, images, videos, 
                    games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
